# OSCMidi

Currently a semi-placeholder until I can make this stuff pretty. But here are the avatar IDs that you can use with VRCX to import:

I AM UNSURE IF THIS WORKS ON MAC :)

The avatars DO NOT MAKE AUDIO, the audio has to come from your mic either through a DAW (Digital Audio Workspace) like FL Studio, Reaper, etc

avtr_f5648902-719f-4193-80b9-8d1581f076b4 - Fresh Pianist, has lightup keys

avtr_2ed21ba8-f484-4fd0-b251-0e53dfe3c9c9 - OSC Piano, has keydown keys and is properly synced with mic audio

Here is everything you will need for this to work:

Python

pip install python-osc
pip install pygame
pip install pygame_menu

And if you want, I would recommend getting a program called LoopBe1 (LoopBeInternalMidi)


Then All you should have to do is launch the program, set your input to your piano and then launch VR Chat, get into the avatar, go into your settings before the expressions menu and turn on OSC then you shuold be good to go!



Also I recognize that the code is not great :) I am a amateur not professional programmer, but I know enough to make things work at least, if you can make this better then please do and make a suggestion / comment or whatever you do in github, I'm new.
